# Unhandled Error in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications where an unhandled error occurs within a page component, crashing the application.  The error stems from attempting to access a property of an undefined variable.

## Bug Description

The `about.js` file attempts to access `nonExistentVariable.someProperty`, where `nonExistentVariable` is undefined.  This results in a runtime error, causing the page to crash and display an error to the user.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a solution by using optional chaining and nullish coalescing to gracefully handle the potential undefined variable.  This prevents the application from crashing and provides a more user-friendly experience. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Navigate to `/about` in your browser.  You will observe the error with the original code and the fixed behavior with the solution.
